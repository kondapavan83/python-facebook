Ipsec:
authentication
integrity
confidentiality
replay (anti)

PHASE1:(control plane)
AUTH           psk(keys) or pki(cert), ikev2 EAP methods(flex vpn)
DIFFIE hellman group (Exchange keys) alice bob private public, group number entropy how long - result symmetric keys
Encryption -   could be hardware offloaded, aes128, 192, 256, ikev2 suiteb beyond aes256
Hashing-      sha or md5, to make sure packet is not modified. sha-1, sha256,384

Isakmp SA ^^ negotiated  - phase 1 initiator and responder checks aginst its parameter for match
ISAKMP uses UDP 500 with NAT UDP 4500

phase 2 (data plane)

1)security protocol -ESP & AH
  ESP - protocol 50 AICR,
  AH-51 - no Encryption AI only, ipv6 ospfv3 neighbor authentication
  IF NAT then ESP over UDP 4500

2)Encapsulation mode: Tunnel or transport
  Tunnel: original ip header retained, Layer4 and payload encrypted with ESP
          complete packet authenticated with AH, used in host to host Ipsec
  Transport: Adds new ip header, original ipv4 header,payload auth and encrypted with ESP
              complete packet authenticated with AH, used between IPsec gateways and host to IPsec gateways

3)Encryption: 3DES, AES,

4)Authentication: MD5, SHA, 256, 512

5)Proxy identities: proxy acls for interesting traffic for protection.
6) SA lifetimes: How often should we re-key, Lifetime can be in bits or time, lower is chosen.
7) Perfect forward secrecy (PFS): When we re-key should we also re-negotiate diffie helman before re-keying (CPU intensive)
